Notes
A URLconf maps URL patterns to views.
ROOT_URLCONF = 'mysite.urls' in settings indicate which file is the URLconf
t finds the variable named urlpatterns and traverses the patterns in order. 
Each view is responsible for doing one of two things: returning an HttpResponse object containing the content for the requested page, or raising an exception such as Http404.
